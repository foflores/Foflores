### Hi, I'm Favian ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at CUNY Hunter College expecting to graduate June 2021. I enjoy solving real world
issues through software development. I have experience in C++/Python and am currently learning
Swift/HTML/CSS. So far most of my coding experience has been through school assignments. I am
looking to expand my knowledge by learning new languages, frameworks, and tools to be able to solve
any problems I come across.

- I'm currently working on building a [personal website](https://www.foflores.com) using django and
bootstrap

- I'm currently learning HTML/CSS in order to build my own website from scratch

- I can be reached on [twitter](https://twitter.com/foflores10/) or on
[linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/foflores10/)
