## Hey, I'm Favian ðŸ‘‹

I graduated CUNY Hunter College in August 2021 with a BA in Computer Science and a minor in Economics. I am currently working at the Manhattan DA's Office as a software developer.

I mainly work with the .NET platform to create web apps and windows apps, but in my free time I like to experiment with other tools and technologies in web, cloud, and devops.

I am currently working on [starting a blog](https://favianflores.com) focused around software development.
