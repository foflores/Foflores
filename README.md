## Hi, I'm Favian ðŸ‘‹

I recently graduated from CUNY Hunter College with a BA in Computer Science and a minor in Economics. I enjoy solving real world issues through software development. I am proficient in Python and have experience in C++, Swift, HTML, and CSS. So far most of my coding experience has been through school assignments. I am looking to expand my knowledge by learning new languages, frameworks, and tools to be able to solve any problems I come across.

- I am currently working on building a [personal website](https://www.foflores.com) using Django and Bootstrap. It is deployed using Nginx and uWSGI on a Linode server.

- I am actively looking for software engineering opportunities
